# Conway's Game of Life - Rust vs C
---

### Overview
A very simple app is made using John Conway's game of life algorithm in C and rust.
The purpose of this project is to compare the look and feel of each of those languages.
The algorithm implemented in both languages are the same, although I tried to do it in the language's 'way of doing things'.
A TUI application is also made to visualise the cells and advance to the next frame.
In rust the ratatui crate was used and in C termbox2.h was used.
In this way, I can compare the work done to solve the same problem in both languages.
